    <h2>About Akan  Names</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Akan people of Ghana</strong> frequently name their children <em>after the day of the week they were
        born</em> and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
      characterof the person. This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora.
    <p>
      During the 18th-19th centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were
      referred to as Coromantees. Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy,
      Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina. Most Ghanaians have at least one name
      from this system, even if they also have an English orChristian name.

    <p>
      Notable figures with day names include <strong><em>Ghana's first president</em>Kwame Nkrumah</strong> and former
      United Nations Secretary-General <strong>Kofi Annan.</strong>
